v0.3.10

    Clarify licensing. Since the original code base was
    GPL-2-or-later, everything is the same, although I would be happy
    with providing my own code under other licenses, too (and perhaps
    Manuel Mausz, the original author, would be happy to re-license
    his parts, too). Let me know if interested.


v0.3.9

    qmail-remote now, instead of just trusting embedded spam score
    headers, sends outgoing mails for a re-check if it's older than 30
    seconds. Also, mails without spam check header will be
    checked. Sadly, this needs access to spamd by the qmail group.

v0.3.8pre3

    Prepare for implementing EdDSA, but can't go forward with it (see
    Github issue).
