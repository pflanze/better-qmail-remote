v0.3.9

    qmail-remote now, instead of just trusting embedded spam score
    headers, sends outgoing mails for a re-check if it's older than 30
    seconds. Also, mails without spam check header will be
    checked. Sadly, this needs access to spamd by the qmail group.

    Prepare for implementing EdDSA, but can't go forward with it (see
    Github issue).
